# Master Thesis

This repository contains the code developed in the context of my master thesis, with the title "A Browser-based Anonymous Questionnaire System with User-controlled Linkability".

The thesis was done in order to obtain my MSc Degree from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (Lisboa, Portugal), and was developed almost entirely at the SPRING lab at EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland) under the supervision of Wouter Lueks.
